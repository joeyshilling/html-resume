<body>
    <p>My name is Joey and I am an aspiring web developer. Currently I work as a software automation tester. I enjoy the coding and problem-solving aspects of my current role and am looking to pivot my career to a path that can allow for more creativity and freelance oportunites. Outside of my professional life I enjoy reading, fiber arts, board games, and hanging out with my cats. I also love researching things I am interested in, with my favorite topics being Tolkien studies and queer theory and history. </p>
